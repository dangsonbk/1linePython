## Notes

- Many of the answers are not really 1-line Python code, as they use functions from libraries.
- Many of the answers are not the best optimized answer. However they fit under the requirement of problem's Execute Time limit.
- Code challenge websites usually imported some default Python libraries, but the list may vary between sites.
