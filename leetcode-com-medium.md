## ðŸ§© Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique

**Source**: [Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/)

**Description**:

> A stringÂ `s`Â is calledÂ **good**Â if there are no two different characters inÂ `s`Â that have the sameÂ **frequency**.
> 
> Given a stringÂ `s`, return *theÂ **minimum**Â number of characters you need to delete to make* `s` ***good**.*
> 
> TheÂ **frequency**Â of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the stringÂ `"aab"`, theÂ **frequency**Â ofÂ `'a'`Â isÂ `2`, while theÂ **frequency**Â ofÂ `'b'`Â isÂ `1`.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
> - `s`Â contains only lowercase English letters.

**Answer**:

```python
return reduce(lambda p, n: [max(0, p[0] - 1), p[1] + n - max(0, p[0] - 1)] if p[0] <= n else [n, p[1]], [[10001, 0]] + sorted(Counter(s).values(), reverse=1))[1]
```

**Explanations**:

- Sort the frequency of letters in decreasing order.

- Seed the `reduce()` function with `[last_value, number_of_deletions] and sorted frequency`

- If any letter's frequency value is equal or larger than previous value, decrease it's value and add the same amount to the `number_of_deletions`.

## ðŸ§© Queue Reconstruction by Height

**Source**: [Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

**Description**:

> You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.
>
> Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

**Answer**:

```python
return reduce(lambda p, n: p[:n[1]] + [n] + p[n[1]:] , [[]] + sorted(people, key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]), reverse=True))
```
